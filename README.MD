# Procedural animated crab using Bevy

Learning a little bit about procedural animation
This project is about giving a try to
[bevy_mod_inverse_kinematics](https://github.com/Kurble/bevy_mod_inverse_kinematics/)

Also using this awesome crab model by [Ischa Soetewey](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/armored-crab-df63d81358944337af1add54f19821ad)

Project needs to be cleaned - I tried a couple of different approach and there is still a lot of hardcoded stuff.

### Tasks

- [x] Walking crab animation
- [x] 4x4 off road support (technically 6x6) - foot height over terrain using raycast
- [ ] Code cleanup
- [ ] Sync opposing legs
- [ ] Better player movement
